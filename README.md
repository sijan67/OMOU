# OMOU

Find songs, animes and podcasts based on your mood. 

## Introduction
Studies have shown that the feeling of loneliness can be more lethal than smoking 15 cigarettes per day. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on the majority of the population, leading people to feel lonely, isolated and depressed; which can be hard to overcome. Our group has developed a web application to elevate the user’s mood based on a personal journal entry that our product takes as an input. This application utilizes Machine Learning models to predict the mood from a given text input. The web application will then be able to recommend anime, podcasts and music based on the user’s current mood.
